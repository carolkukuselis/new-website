    <h1>About Cats</h1>
    <p>Cats are very friendly animals, cute, cuddly, playfull, and very furry. I like to watch them run through the
        house and chase each other. I have two cats and they like to sleep alot.</p>

    <p>Cats are pretty easy to take care of, just give them their food and water, and a litter box. They also have some
        toys to play with, like a string or a ball. Some people like to have cats around to keep the mice away.</p>
